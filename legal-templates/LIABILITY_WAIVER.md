# WCAG AI Platform Liability Waiver and Release

**IMPORTANT:** Please read this document carefully before using WCAG AI Platform.

---

## ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF LIMITATIONS

Client acknowledges and agrees that:

### 1. Automated Testing Limitations

The WCAG AI Platform Service performs **automated accessibility scanning only**. Client understands and agrees that:

1. **Incomplete Coverage**: Automated tools cannot detect all accessibility issues. Some violations may be missed, and the Service may report false positives.

2. **No Legal Guarantee**: Passing automated scans does NOT guarantee compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 508, WCAG standards, or any other legal accessibility requirements.

3. **Manual Testing Required**: Comprehensive accessibility assessment requires manual testing with assistive technologies (screen readers, voice control, etc.) by qualified accessibility professionals.

4. **Dynamic Content Limitations**: JavaScript-rendered content, third-party embeds, and dynamic functionality may be partially or completely unavailable to automated scanners.

5. **Contextual Issues**: Many accessibility issues are contextual and cannot be detected by automated analysis. Examples include:
   - Semantic meaning issues
   - Focus management in interactive widgets
   - Complex table structures
   - Form field relationships
   - Page structure and navigation intent

7. Client's breach of this Waiver or the Service Agreement

---

## SPECIFIC DISCLAIMERS

### 1. ADA/Section 508 Compliance

**WCAG AI Platform is NOT a guarantee of ADA or Section 508 compliance.**

- The ADA and Section 508 require both WCAG 2.1 compliance AND overall accessibility
- Automated testing cannot assess overall accessibility
- Courts have found WCAG compliance alone to be insufficient for ADA compliance
- "WCAG Compliant" does not mean "ADA Compliant" or "Lawsuit Proof"

### 2. WCAG Levels

**The Service scans against WCAG standards but does not guarantee any WCAG level.**

- Passing automated scanning does NOT mean achieving WCAG Level A, AA, or AAA
- Some WCAG criteria require manual assessment
- Accessibility is not binary (pass/fail)—it exists on a spectrum

### 3. Industry Standards

**Results are based on industry-standard automated tools but are not error-proof.**

Tools used include axe-core, Pa11y, and WAVE. These are well-regarded but have limitations:
- False positive and false negative rates
- Limited ability to assess context
- No ability to test with actual assistive technology

---

## NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR USE

Client agrees that use of WCAG AI Platform is contingent on:

1. **Professional Review**: Client will have scan results reviewed by qualified accessibility professionals
2. **Manual Testing**: Client will conduct manual accessibility testing independent of the Service
3. **Legal Counsel**: Client will consult with legal counsel regarding accessibility compliance
4. **Independent Verification**: Client will verify results independently
5. **Reasonable Documentation**: Client will maintain documentation of testing and remediation efforts
