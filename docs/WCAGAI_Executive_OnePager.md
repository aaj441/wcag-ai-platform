## 🤝 The Consultant Oath

```
I solemnly affirm:

1. I will never approve a violation I have not personally verified.
2. I will prioritize disabled users over client convenience.
3. I will explain my reasoning transparently in every review.
4. I will treat accessibility as justice, not a checkbox.
5. I will measure success by lives changed, not audits completed.

By this oath, I bind myself to the Masonic Code of WCAG AI.
```

**This is not marketing. This is our covenant.**
