## 7. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

### Direct Competitors

| Company | Approach | Price | Weakness | Our Advantage |
|---------|----------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **accessiBe** | AI overlay | $500-5K/mo | Lawsuit risk, not fixes | Real code-level fixes |
| **UserWay** | AI overlay | $500-10K/mo | Doesn't fix code | Actual remediation |
| **Siteimprove** | Enterprise platform | $50K+/year | Mid-market too expensive | SMB pricing ($999) |
| **Level Access** | Manual audits | $5-20K/project | Slow, one-time | Ongoing automation |

### Our Competitive Advantages
✅ **Automated code fixes** (not overlays - real compliance)
✅ **Mid-market pricing** ($999-$9,999 sweet spot)
✅ **Fast delivery** (72-hour initial fixes)
✅ **Ongoing monitoring** (competitors = one-time)
✅ **Legal protection docs** (compliance certificates, audit trails)
✅ **Better ROI** (customers see traffic/conversion gains)

### Indirect Competitors
- Web development agencies (slow, expensive, don't specialize)
- In-house developers (most SMBs don't have them)
- DIY website builders (Wix, Squarespace - not accessible by default)
- Freelancers (inconsistent quality, no ongoing support)

### Why We Win
1. **Specialization:** We obsess over accessibility (they don't)
2. **Automation:** We scale, they hire headcount
3. **Business Model:** Recurring revenue > project revenue
4. **Customer Success:** We have skin in the game (ongoing liability)

---

## 8. KEY RISKS & MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Risk 1: Legal Liability for "Guaranteed Compliance"
**Problem:** We guarantee compliance but client still gets sued
**Probability:** LOW (but high impact)
**Mitigation:**
- E&O insurance ($2M policy - $3K/year)
- Service agreement includes liability limitations
- Partner with accessibility lawyers for 2nd opinions
- Offer optional legal defense fund ($50/mo add-on)
- Document all remediation work (audit trail)

### Risk 2: Technology Obsolescence
**Problem:** WCAG 3.0 or new standards make tools outdated
**Probability:** MEDIUM (happens every 5-10 years)
**Mitigation:**
- Modular architecture (easy to swap components)
- Subscribe to WCAG working group changes
- Regular updates to scanning engine (monthly)
- Keep AI models current (quarterly)

### Risk 3: Customer Acquisition Cost Too High
**Problem:** CAC exceeds $50 (breaks unit economics)
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:**
- Automate everything (reduce manual work)
- Free audit lead magnet (low-cost acquisition)
- Referral program (20% discount for each referral)
- Content marketing (organic traffic reduces CAC)
- Niche targeting (higher conversion = lower CAC)

### Risk 4: High Churn Rate
**Problem:** Clients cancel after initial fix
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:**
- Show ongoing value (monthly compliance reports)
- New regulations = new violations (they need us)
- Annual contracts with 10% discount (lock-in)
- Customer success team (proactive outreach)
- NPS tracking + quarterly reviews

### Risk 5: Market Saturation
**Problem:** Competitors enter and undercut pricing
**Probability:** MEDIUM (everyone sees the opportunity)
**Mitigation:**
- First-mover advantage (brand, case studies)
- Network effects (more customers = more data = better product)
- Switching costs (integrated into their workflow)
- Continuous innovation (stay ahead technically)
