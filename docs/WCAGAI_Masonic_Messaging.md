## Core Message

**Repeat this everywhere:**

### The One-Sentence Mission
"WCAG AI combines artificial intelligence with expert human verification to deliver $5,000 accessibility audits in 48 hours—10x cheaper and 50x faster than traditional consulting, with 92%+ accuracy."

### The Three Core Values (Always Include)
1. **Accessibility is justice, not charity** - We serve disabled communities, not exploit them
2. **AI + Human > Either alone** - Technology amplifies expertise, never replaces it
3. **Measured in lives changed, not revenue** - Impact matters more than profit

### The Transformation We Enable
- **FROM**: $50K audits in 12 weeks, limited to 50 pages, consultant burnout
- **TO**: $5K audits in 48 hours, unlimited pages, consultants thriving

### The Masonic Oath (Short Version)
"We pledge to uphold Truth (accuracy), Relief (speed), and Brotherly Love (service) in every audit we deliver."

---

## 30-Second Elevator Pitches

### Standard Pitch (For Everyone)
"Accessibility audits cost $50,000 and take 12 weeks. We use AI to scan websites in 30 seconds, then certified consultants verify every violation in 2 hours. The result? $5,000 audits delivered in 48 hours with 92%+ accuracy. We've made accessibility affordable for businesses and meaningful work for consultants. The ripoff economy is dead."

### Masonic Version (For Aligned Audiences)
"We built WCAG AI on Masonic principles: Truth, Relief, and Brotherly Love. AI handles tedious scanning. Consultants provide expert verification. Together, we deliver accessible justice at 1/10th the cost in 1/50th the time. Our oath? Serve disabled communities, pay consultants fairly, publish our accuracy metrics, and never compromise integrity for profit."

### Technical Pitch (For Developers)
"WCAG AI is a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 runs axe-core and Pa11y to detect violations. Stage 2 uses GPT-4 to score confidence (0-1.0) based on pattern matching and context analysis. Consultants review only HIGH and MEDIUM confidence violations, rejecting false positives. The result? 98% approval rate for HIGH confidence, 75% for MEDIUM, 92%+ overall accuracy."

### Impact Pitch (For Nonprofits/Advocates)
"26% of Americans have a disability. Most websites are inaccessible because audits cost $50K. We use AI to make audits 10x cheaper. Now small businesses, nonprofits, and schools can afford compliance. More audits = more accessible websites = more disabled people can work, shop, and live independently. That's justice."

### Investor Pitch (For VCs)
"The accessibility compliance market is $8B annually. Traditional firms charge $50K per audit with 70% margins but can only do 10 audits per consultant per year. We charge $5K with 94% margins and enable 250 audits per consultant per year. Unit economics are 3x better at 1/10th the price. The moat? Our proprietary violation dataset gets smarter with every audit."

## Sales Pitches by Buyer Type

### Enterprise (Fortune 500 CIO)

**Opening Hook:**
"Your last accessibility audit cost $50,000, took 12 weeks, and only covered your homepage and 50 subpages. How much of your site is still unaudited?"

**The Problem:**
Your organization faces four accessibility challenges:
1. **Legal risk**: ADA lawsuits cost $300K+ in settlements and legal fees
2. **Coverage gaps**: Traditional audits sample 50-100 pages, missing 95% of your site
3. **Slow remediation**: 12-week turnaround means violations persist for months
4. **Budget constraints**: $50K per audit limits how often you can test

**The Solution:**
WCAG AI delivers:
- **Unlimited coverage**: Scan your entire site (10,000+ pages) for the same price
- **48-hour turnaround**: Identify violations before they become lawsuits
- **$5,000 per audit**: Audit quarterly instead of annually
- **Expert-verified**: Every violation reviewed by certified consultants

**The ROI:**
- **Avoid one lawsuit**: Save $300K+ in legal fees (60x the audit cost)
- **Quarterly audits**: Monitor continuously instead of annual snapshots
- **Complete coverage**: Audit every page, not just samples
- **Faster remediation**: Fix violations in days, not months

**Social Proof:**
"We've audited 25,000+ pages for healthcare, finance, and e-commerce companies. Our reports have been accepted in 15+ legal proceedings. 98% of customers renew annually."

**Call to Action:**
"Let's run a free pilot audit on 100 pages of your site. We'll deliver the report in 48 hours. If you're not impressed by the coverage and accuracy, you owe us nothing."

---

### Nonprofit (ED with Limited Budget)

**Opening Hook:**
"You know your website should be accessible. But when audits cost $50,000, accessibility feels like a luxury you can't afford."

**The Problem:**
Your nonprofit faces an impossible choice:
1. **Mission vs. compliance**: Spend $50K on an audit or serve 500 more people?
2. **Grant restrictions**: Many funders won't pay for accessibility audits
3. **Lawsuit risk**: Disabled users can still sue, regardless of your budget
4. **Technical debt**: The longer you wait, the more expensive remediation becomes

**The Solution:**
WCAG AI was built for organizations like yours:
- **Nonprofit pricing**: $2,500 (50% discount from standard $5,000)
- **48-hour turnaround**: Get results before your next board meeting
- **Expert-verified**: Certified consultants review every violation
- **Remediation roadmap**: Prioritized fix list so you know what to tackle first

**The Mission Alignment:**
We're a mission-driven company:
- 5% of revenue donated to disability rights organizations
- Pro-bono audits for disability advocacy groups
- Consultants paid fairly ($100/hour vs. industry $75/hour)
- Open-source tools available to all

**The Math:**
- **Your audit**: $2,500 (nonprofit rate)
- **Traditional audit**: $50,000
- **Savings**: $47,500
- **What you can do with $47,500**: Serve 500 more people, hire a part-time developer to fix violations, fund your actual mission

**Call to Action:**
"Apply for our Nonprofit Accessibility Program. If approved, we'll audit your website for $2,500 with payment plans available. Let's make accessibility achievable, not aspirational."

---

### Government (Procurement Officer)

**Opening Hook:**
"Section 508 requires federal websites to be accessible. When was your last comprehensive audit? How much did it cost? How long did it take?"

**The Problem:**
Government agencies face unique accessibility challenges:
1. **Legal mandate**: Section 508 compliance is not optional
2. **Public scrutiny**: Lawsuits and media coverage damage reputation
3. **Budget cycles**: $50K audits require months of procurement paperwork
4. **Large site portfolios**: Agencies manage dozens of sites with limited budgets

**The Solution:**
WCAG AI meets government procurement requirements:
- **Section 508 compliant**: Audits follow federal accessibility standards
- **Expert verification**: Certified accessibility consultants review all reports
- **Legally defensible**: Reports accepted in 15+ legal proceedings
- **Scalable pricing**: Volume discounts for multi-site portfolios

**Government Pricing:**
- **Single site**: $5,000
- **5-10 sites**: $4,000 per site
- **11-25 sites**: $3,500 per site
- **26+ sites**: Custom pricing

**Procurement Benefits:**
- **Small purchase threshold**: Most audits under $10K simplify procurement
- **48-hour delivery**: No lengthy SOWs or project timelines
- **GSA Schedule ready**: Working toward GSA approval (available Q2 2026)
- **Fixed-price contracts**: No cost overruns or change orders

**Emergency Response:**
Critical violations (inaccessible voting sites, emergency services, medical forms):
- **8-hour turnaround** for critical sites
- **Free initial scan** if lawsuit pending
- **Priority consultant assignment**

**Call to Action:**
"Request a free pilot audit of your highest-traffic site. We'll deliver a comprehensive report in 48 hours. Use it to justify budget allocation and demonstrate due diligence to oversight committees."

---

### Disabled Advocate (Community Leader)

**Opening Hook:**
"You've spent years fighting for accessibility. You've filed complaints, educated businesses, and advocated for change. But inaccessible websites still block disabled people from jobs, healthcare, and civic life. Why?"

**The Problem:**
The accessibility industry is broken:
1. **Audits are expensive**: $50K puts compliance out of reach for small businesses
2. **DIY tools are inaccurate**: 85% false positive rate wastes everyone's time
3. **Consultants are burned out**: Tedious work, low pay, high turnover
4. **Disabled voices ignored**: Product decisions made without community input

**The Solution:**
WCAG AI was built WITH disabled communities, not FOR them:
- **Community Advisory Board**: Disabled advocates vote on product decisions
- **Affordable audits**: $5K price point makes compliance achievable
- **Faster remediation**: 48-hour reports = faster fixes = fewer barriers
- **Consultant oath**: Every auditor pledges to serve disabled communities

**How We're Different:**
Traditional consulting firms:
- **Extractive**: Take $50K, deliver a PDF, disappear
- **Opaque**: No published accuracy metrics
- **Profit-driven**: Maximize billable hours, not impact

WCAG AI:
- **Transparent**: Publish accuracy metrics monthly
- **Mission-driven**: Measure success in lives changed
- **Community-governed**: Advisory board has veto power on features

**Partnership Opportunities:**
1. **Free audits**: Pro-bono for disability advocacy organizations
2. **Referral program**: Earn $500 for every business you refer
3. **Advisory board**: Join our community board (paid position)
4. **Speaker opportunities**: Co-present at conferences about accessibility justice

**The Oath We Take:**
"I pledge to advocate for users, not just audit websites. To recommend the most accessible solution, not the cheapest. To listen to disabled advocates and implement their feedback."

**Call to Action:**
"Join our Community Advisory Board. You'll review product features before launch, vote on major decisions, and receive equity in the company. Let's build the accessibility industry we wish existed."

## LinkedIn Post Templates

### Template 1: The Cost Breakdown (Viral Potential)

**Hook:**
The accessibility industry is a $50,000 ripoff. Here's the math:

**Body:**
Traditional accessibility audit:
- Cost: $50,000
- Time: 12 weeks
- Pages covered: 50-100
- Consultant time: 200 hours
- Consultant pay: $75/hour = $15,000
- Firm profit: $35,000 (70% margin)

WCAG AI audit:
- Cost: $5,000
- Time: 48 hours
- Pages covered: Unlimited
- Consultant time: 2 hours
- Consultant pay: $100/hour = $200
- Platform profit: $4,700 (94% margin)

Result:
✅ Customers save $45,000
✅ Consultants earn more per hour
✅ We profit more per audit
✅ Disabled users get more accessible websites

The ripoff economy dies when you prove it doesn't have to exist.

**CTA:**
What other industries need this disruption? 👇

### Template 2: The Consultant Story (Emotional)

**Hook:**
"I used to audit 10 websites per year and burn out. Now I audit 250 and love my job."

**Body:**
Meet Sarah, a certified accessibility consultant.

Before WCAG AI:
- Manually tested each page (2.4 hours per page)
- Documented violations in spreadsheets
- Took screenshots manually
- Wrote recommendations from scratch
- Worked 80-hour weeks during audits
- Earned $75/hour
- Completed 10 audits per year
- Burned out after 3 years

After WCAG AI:
- AI scans sites in 30 seconds

- Focuses on expertise, not data entry
- Works sustainable 40-hour weeks
- Earns $100/hour
- Completes 250 audits per year
- Loves her job

"I finally get to do what I was trained for: expert judgment, not tedious testing. And I'm paid fairly for my expertise."

The future of work is AI handling drudgery and humans doing what we're best at.

**CTA:**
Tag a consultant who deserves better work 👇

---

### Template 3: The Impact Metrics (Data-Driven)

**Hook:**
We just hit 25,000 accessibility violations fixed. Here's what that means:

**Body:**
25,000 violations fixed =
- 500 websites made accessible
- 10M disabled users can now access services they couldn't before
- $12.5M saved (vs. traditional audits)
- 50 consultants earning sustainable income
- 0 lawsuits for our customers (so far)

Breaking down the impact:
👁️ Vision: 8,500 fixes (missing alt text, color contrast, etc.)
🖱️ Motor: 6,200 fixes (keyboard navigation, touch targets)
🧠 Cognitive: 5,800 fixes (clear language, consistent navigation)
👂 Hearing: 4,500 fixes (captions, transcripts)

Every violation we fix is a barrier removed.
Every barrier removed is a life improved.

This is what happens when you optimize for impact, not revenue.

**CTA:**
What metric should we track next? 💭

---

### Template 4: The Founder's Oath (Authenticity)

**Hook:**
I just signed an oath in front of 50 accessibility consultants. Here's what I pledged:

**Body:**
The WCAG AI Masonic Oath:

"I solemnly swear to:
1. Prioritize mission over margin
2. Never sacrifice accuracy for profit
3. Publish our accuracy metrics monthly
4. Pay consultants fairly and on time
5. Listen to disabled communities
6. Keep core tools open-source
7. Donate 5% of revenue to disability advocacy
8. Accept responsibility for our failures"

This isn't a marketing document. It's a binding contract.

If we violate this oath:
- Community Advisory Board can remove me as CEO
- Consultants can immediately terminate contracts
- Customers can demand full refunds

Why? Because accessibility is justice, not charity.

And justice requires accountability.

**CTA:**
What other startups should make public oaths? 🤔

---

### Template 5: The False Positive Problem (Educational)

**Hook:**
DIY accessibility tools report 500 violations. Our consultants verified 47. Here's why:

**Body:**
The false positive problem:

DIY tools (WAVE, axe DevTools):
- Report: 500 violations
- False positives: 85%
- True violations: 75
- Customer action: Ignore the tool (too overwhelming)

WCAG AI:
- AI detects: 500 potential violations
- Confidence scoring filters: 342 HIGH/MEDIUM
- Consultant reviews: 342
- Consultant approves: 233
- Consultant rejects: 109 (false positives)
- Report includes: 233 verified violations
- False positive rate: 12%

The result:
✅ Customer trusts the report
✅ Developers fix real violations
✅ Disabled users benefit

AI without human verification = noise.
Humans without AI = too slow.
AI + Human = accurate and scalable.

**CTA:**
Ever wasted time on false positives? Share your story 👇

---

### Template 6: The Pricing Philosophy (Transparent)

**Hook:**
We make 94% gross margin and still charge 1/10th the price. How?

**Body:**
Traditional consulting economics:
- Price: $50,000
- Consultant cost: $15,000 (200 hours × $75/hour)
- Gross margin: 70% ($35,000)
- Overhead: High (office, sales, project managers)
- Net margin: ~40%

WCAG AI economics:
- Price: $5,000
- AI cost: $50 (compute)
- Consultant cost: $200 (2 hours × $100/hour)
- Infrastructure: $65
- Gross margin: 94% ($4,700)
- Overhead: Low (fully remote, automated sales)
- Net margin: ~50%

The secret? Volume.
- Traditional: 10 audits per consultant per year
- WCAG AI: 250 audits per consultant per year

More audits = more profit per consultant = lower price = more customers = more audits.

This is how you disrupt entrenched industries: prove the fat margins aren't necessary.

**CTA:**
What industry should we disrupt next? 💡

---

### Template 7: The Lawsuit That Changed Everything (Story)

**Hook:**
A small business owner called me crying. She'd just been sued for $300K. Her website had missing alt text on 12 images.

**Body:**
Maria runs a bakery. Annual revenue: $400K.

She got sued under the ADA:
- Violation: 12 images missing alt text
- Lawsuit settlement: $300,000
- Legal fees: $50,000
- Total cost: $350,000
- Nearly bankrupted her business

She asked me: "How much would it have cost to fix this?"

My answer:
- WCAG AI audit: $5,000
- Developer to fix 12 images: $500
- Total prevention cost: $5,500

$5,500 to prevent a $350,000 lawsuit.
That's a 6,363% ROI.

But here's the real tragedy: Maria didn't know audits existed. She thought they were only for big corporations.

That's why we're making accessibility audits affordable and accessible.

Because small business owners shouldn't lose everything over 12 missing alt tags.

**CTA:**
Know a small business owner? Share this. It might save their livelihood. 🔗

## Investor Pitch Narrative

### The Complete 10-Minute Pitch

**Slide 1: The Hook**

"The accessibility compliance market is $8 billion annually. It's dominated by consulting firms charging $50,000 for 12 weeks of work. We deliver the same audit for $5,000 in 48 hours with higher accuracy. We're not 10% better. We're 10x cheaper and 50x faster."

---

**Slide 2: The Problem**

26% of Americans have a disability. Federal law requires websites to be accessible. But compliance is broken:

**For Customers:**
- $50K price tag puts audits out of reach for SMBs
- 12-week timeline means violations persist for months
- Limited coverage (50-100 pages) misses most of the site
- Legal risk: ADA lawsuits cost $300K+ in settlements

**For Consultants:**
- Tedious manual testing (200 hours per audit)
- Low pay ($75/hour despite expertise)
- High burnout (3-year average tenure)
- Can only complete 10 audits per year

**For Disabled Users:**
- Inaccessible websites block access to jobs, healthcare, shopping
- Small businesses can't afford compliance, so barriers persist
- DIY tools have 85% false positive rates, wasting everyone's time

Result: Everyone loses except predatory law firms.
