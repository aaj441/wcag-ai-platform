## THE FOUR PILLARS AT WORK

```
🔷 BROTHERLY LOVE        🔷 RELIEF
   Disabled users guide       Consultants earn
   all decisions              $125K/year

🔷 TRUTH                 🔷 CHARITY
   Confidence scores          Accessibility is
   + audit trails             justice, not profit
```

## THREE KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Confidence Scoring is the Moat
```
AI finds 30 violations
↓
GPT-4 rates each one (0.0-1.0)
↓
18 high-confidence → auto-approve
12 low-confidence → consultant review (fast)
↓
Result: Consultant 40x more efficient
Moat: Competitors can't match speed
```

### 2. Disabled Leadership is Non-Negotiable
```
Every product decision requires:
- Disabled user approval
- Consultant network input
- Accessibility-first metric

Why? Because disabled people KNOW what works.
And they're our customer.
```

### 3. Mission > Profit (At Scale)
```
If we hit $500M revenue but lose:
- Disabled community trust → FAIL
- Consultant compensation → FAIL
- Transparent audit trails → FAIL
- Mission alignment → FAIL

We'd rather be $50M/year with integrity
than $500M/year compromised.
```
