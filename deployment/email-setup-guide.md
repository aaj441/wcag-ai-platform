## Email Templates for Each Industry

### Fintech Email Template

```
Subject: [Company] Mobile Banking App - Critical Accessibility Gap

Hi [First Name],

I ran a quick scan on [Company]'s mobile app and found 12 WCAG violations
that could trigger ADA lawsuits.

With CFPB now enforcing accessibility under UDAAP, one lawsuit could cost
$50K-$500K in settlements.

I can send you the full report (takes 30 seconds to generate).
Want to see what we found?

Best,
[Your Name]
WCAG AI Compliance
```

### Healthcare Email Template

```
Subject: [Hospital/Clinic] Patient Portal - HIPAA + ADA Exposure

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Is [Company]'s patient portal WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant?

Recent OCR guidance makes accessibility part of HIPAA compliance.
We found 18 violations on your appointment scheduling flow that could
trigger both ADA lawsuits AND OCR investigations.

Want the detailed report? (Free, takes 30 seconds)

Best,
[Your Name]
WCAG AI Compliance
```

### Debt Collector Email Template

```
Subject: [Company] Payment Portal - FDCPA + ADA Compliance Risk

Hi [First Name],

Debt collectors are facing a wave of ADA lawsuits (500+ in 2024).
I scanned [Company]'s payment portal and found 15 WCAG violations.

Under FDCPA, inaccessible communication = unfair practice = $1,000 per violation.

Can I send you the full accessibility audit? (No obligation, takes 30 seconds)

Best,
[Your Name]
WCAG AI Compliance
