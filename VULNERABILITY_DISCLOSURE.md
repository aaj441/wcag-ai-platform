## 📝 Reporting Process

### Step 1: Report Submission

**Preferred Method - GitHub Security Advisory (Private):**
1. Navigate to [https://github.com/aaj441/wcag-ai-platform/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/aaj441/wcag-ai-platform/security/advisories/new)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill in the vulnerability details (see template below)
4. Submit - only maintainers can see this

**Alternative - Encrypted Email:**
- Email: security@wcagai.com
- PGP Key: [Download our PGP key](https://wcagai.com/.well-known/pgp-key.txt)
- For urgent P0 vulnerabilities: Include "[P0]" in subject line

**Emergency Hotline (P0 Only):**
- Phone: +1 (555) WCAG-SEC (24/7 for critical vulnerabilities)
- Use only for actively exploited vulnerabilities or data breaches

### Step 2: Initial Response

**We will acknowledge your report within:**
- P0 (Critical): 1 hour
- P1 (High): 4 hours
- P2 (Medium): 24 hours
- P3 (Low): 48 hours

### Step 3: Triage & Validation

Our security team will:
1. Reproduce the vulnerability
2. Assess severity using CVSS 3.1
3. Assign a priority (P0-P3)
4. Create an internal remediation plan

**You will receive:**
- Confirmation of vulnerability or explanation if not accepted
- Estimated timeline for fix
- Unique tracking ID (VUL-YYYY-NNNN)

### Step 4: Remediation

**Timeline Commitments:**

| Severity | CVSS Score | Fix Timeline | Public Disclosure |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **P0 - Critical** | 9.0-10.0 | 24-48 hours | After fix deployed + 7 days |
| **P1 - High** | 7.0-8.9 | 7 days | After fix deployed + 14 days |
| **P2 - Medium** | 4.0-6.9 | 30 days | After fix deployed + 30 days |
| **P3 - Low** | 0.1-3.9 | 90 days | After fix deployed + 90 days |

**We will keep you updated:**
- Weekly status updates (minimum)
- Notification when fix is deployed
- Draft security advisory for your review

### Step 5: Public Disclosure

**Coordinated Disclosure:**
- We will coordinate disclosure timing with you
- Default: 90 days after initial report OR when fix is deployed (whichever is sooner)
- Early disclosure possible if actively exploited
- You may publish your own writeup after our advisory

**Our Security Advisory Will Include:**
- Vulnerability description
- Affected versions
- Fixed versions
- Workarounds (if any)
- Credit to researcher (unless you prefer anonymity)
- CVE identifier (if applicable)

## 🔍 Scope

### In-Scope Assets

| Asset | Description | Priority |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Production API** | https://api.wcagai.com/* | Critical |
| **Production Web App** | https://app.wcagai.com/* | Critical |
| **Marketing Site** | https://wcagai.com/* | High |
| **Authentication** | Clerk integration | Critical |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (Railway) | Critical |
| **Queue System** | Redis/Bull | High |
| **Scan Engine** | Puppeteer/WCAG scanner | Critical |

### Out-of-Scope Assets

❌ **Do NOT test these:**
- Third-party services (Clerk, Stripe, SendGrid, Railway)
- Our employees' personal devices or accounts
- Physical security of offices
- Social engineering of employees
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Spam or brute force attacks

**Note:** Testing out-of-scope assets may result in disqualification from the program and potential legal action.

## 🎯 Vulnerability Types

### High Priority

We are particularly interested in:

✅ **Authentication & Authorization**
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation
- JWT/session token vulnerabilities
- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

✅ **Injection Vulnerabilities**
- SQL Injection
- NoSQL Injection
- Command Injection
- SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

✅ **Data Exposure**
- Unauthorized access to scan results
- PII disclosure
- API key leakage
- Database exposure

✅ **Business Logic Flaws**
- Payment bypass (Stripe integration)
- Rate limiting bypass
- Queue manipulation
- Scan result tampering

✅ **Supply Chain**
- Vulnerable dependencies (with exploitability proof)
- Compromised build pipeline
- Malicious packages

### Lower Priority (But Still Welcome!)

⚠️ **We will accept these but with lower severity:**
- Self-XSS
- Missing security headers (without demonstrated impact)
- Clickjacking (on non-sensitive pages)
- Outdated dependencies (without known exploits)
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC issues
- SSL/TLS configuration weaknesses
- Verbose error messages (without data exposure)

### Not Accepted

❌ **These will NOT qualify:**
- Issues only exploitable on outdated browsers
- Missing rate limiting (without demonstrated abuse)
- Descriptive error messages (without sensitive data)
- Host header injection (without demonstrated impact)
- Open redirects to non-malicious sites
- CSV injection
- Tabnabbing
- Issues requiring unlikely user interaction
- Recently disclosed zero-day in third-party dependencies (give us 30 days to patch)

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Can I test WCAGAI without prior authorization?

**A:** Yes, as long as you follow this policy and only test in-scope assets. This policy grants you authorization for responsible security testing.

### Q: Will you pay bug bounties?

**A:** We currently do not offer monetary rewards, but we provide public recognition and donate to charities on your behalf for critical findings. We may launch a paid bug bounty program in the future.

### Q: Can I run automated scanners?

**A:** Please ask first. Email security@wcagai.com with your scanning plan. Automated scanners can cause false positives and service disruption.

### Q: What if I accidentally access user data during testing?

**A:** Stop immediately, do not save or share the data, and report the vulnerability to us. We understand accidents happen during security research.

### Q: Can I publish a blog post about my finding?

**A:** Yes! After our coordinated disclosure date, you are free to publish your research. We encourage security education.

### Q: How do you calculate severity?

**A:** We use CVSS 3.1 scoring combined with business impact assessment. See [CVSS Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1).

### Q: What if I disagree with your severity assessment?

**A:** We're open to discussion. Provide additional context about the impact, and we'll reconsider. Our security team makes the final decision.

### Q: Can I test the mobile apps?

**A:** We don't currently have mobile apps. If/when we launch them, this policy will be updated.
