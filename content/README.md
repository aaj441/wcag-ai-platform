## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Legal & Ethical
- ✅ **DO:** Cite specific WCAG guidelines and date of testing
- ✅ **DO:** Focus on product improvement, not company shaming
- ✅ **DO:** Acknowledge when companies fix issues
- ❌ **DON'T:** Make legal claims ("This is illegal")
- ❌ **DON'T:** Exaggerate severity for engagement
- ❌ **DON'T:** Test only once without verification

### Brand Alignment
All content should align with WCAG AI Platform's core messaging:
- **People First** - Center disabled users in the conversation
- **Solution-Oriented** - Show how to fix, not just what's broken
- **"Cyborg Shield"** - AI + Human verification approach
- **Justice, Not Charity** - Accessibility is a right, not a favor

See [WCAGAI_Masonic_Messaging.md](../WCAGAI_Masonic_Messaging.md) for complete brand voice guidelines.

## 🔄 Content Repurposing

One AI tool audit can become:

1. **LinkedIn Post** (primary)
2. **Twitter Thread** (condensed version)
3. **Blog Post** (expanded with technical details)
4. **Newsletter Content** (weekly roundup)
5. **Video Script** (for YouTube/TikTok)
6. **Case Study** (for consulting proposals)

**Maximize ROI by repurposing each audit across platforms.**
