# Sample LinkedIn Post - Notion AI Teardown

This is an example of what a completed LinkedIn post looks like using the AI Accessibility Teardown template.

## Final Post (Ready to Copy-Paste to LinkedIn)

I spent an hour analyzing the new AI chatbot for Notion AI.

It's brilliant, but it fails one critical test: **AI Accessibility**.

Here's the 30-second teardown:

❌ **Keyboard Trap:** I couldn't navigate out of the response window without using a mouse. This locks out many users with motor disabilities. (WCAG 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap)
❌ **Cognitive Overload:** The AI generates massive walls of text with no option to summarize or simplify. This is a barrier for users with ADHD or dyslexia.
❌ **No ARIA Labels:** The "regenerate response" button isn't properly labeled for screen readers. A blind user wouldn't even know it's there.

These aren't just "usability issues." They are compliance risks that open the door to ADA lawsuits and exclude over 25% of the population.

The fix? It's not about abandoning AI. It's about implementing a "Cyborg" approach:
1. Automate Scans in CI/CD
2. Human-in-the-Loop Audits
3. Build an Evidence Vault

AI is creating a new wave of legal risk for tech companies. But it's also the only scalable way to solve it.

I'm building a playbook for SaaS companies to turn this risk into an advantage. Follow me for more "Cyborg Shield" strategies.

## How This Post Was Created

### 1. Chose Target Tool
Selected **Notion AI** because it's popular with SaaS product teams (our target audience).

### 2. Conducted Testing (15 minutes)
- **Keyboard Test:** Tried navigating with Tab key only, got stuck in chat window
- **Screen Reader Test:** Opened NVDA, found "regenerate" button had no label
- **Cognitive Test:** Generated long response, found no summarization option

### 3. Mapped to WCAG Guidelines (5 minutes)
- Keyboard trap → WCAG 2.1.2
- Wall of text → General cognitive accessibility principle
- Unlabeled button → WCAG 4.1.2 (implied)

### 4. Filled Template (5 minutes)
- Used standard Cyborg Shield solution steps
- Added industry-standard stats (25% exclusion)
- Kept hashtags relevant to SaaS audience

### 5. Posted & Engaged
- Posted on Tuesday at 9 AM for maximum reach
- Replied to comments within first hour
- Tracked impressions: 3,200 after 48 hours
