---

## 🚀 Getting Started (30 Minutes)

### Step 1: Choose Your Target Tool (5 min)
Pick an AI tool that your target audience uses:

**For SaaS Executives:**
- ChatGPT, Notion AI, Jasper AI

**For Developers:**
- GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Replit AI

**For Enterprise:**
- Salesforce Einstein, Microsoft Copilot, Zoom AI

**For Designers:**
- Figma AI, Midjourney, Canva AI

### Step 2: Conduct Basic Testing (15 min)
You don't need expensive tools. Start with:

#### Keyboard Testing
1. Open the AI tool
2. Unplug your mouse (or don't touch it)
3. Try to navigate using only:
   - `Tab` key (move forward)
   - `Shift + Tab` (move backward)
   - `Enter` (activate buttons)
   - `Esc` (close dialogs)
4. **Document any place you get stuck**

#### Screen Reader Testing (Free)
- **Windows:** Built-in Narrator
- **Mac:** Built-in VoiceOver (Cmd+F5)
- **Chrome:** ChromeVox extension

Turn on screen reader and try to:
- Navigate the interface
- Understand button purposes
- Know when AI is responding
- **Document anything that's unclear or silent**

#### Visual Testing
- Check color contrast: [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- Try zooming to 200% (Ctrl/Cmd +)
- **Document any text that becomes unreadable**

### Step 3: Map to WCAG Guidelines (5 min)

Match your findings to WCAG references:

| Issue Found | WCAG Guideline | Severity |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Can't use keyboard | 2.1.1 Keyboard | Critical |
| Get stuck (keyboard trap) | 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap | Critical |
| Missing button labels | 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | High |
| Poor contrast | 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) | High |
| No alt text | 1.1.1 Non-text Content | Medium |
| Confusing layout | 1.3.1 Info and Relationships | Medium |

**Use the [WCAG Quick Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) for full list**

### Step 4: Write Your Post (5 min)

Use the template from `AI_ACCESSIBILITY_TEARDOWN_TEMPLATE.md`:

```markdown
I spent [TIME] analyzing [TOOL_NAME].

It's brilliant, but it fails one critical test: **AI Accessibility**.

Here's the 30-second teardown:

❌ **[Violation 1]:** [Description]. (WCAG [Reference])
❌ **[Violation 2]:** [Description]. (WCAG [Reference])
❌ **[Violation 3]:** [Description]. (WCAG [Reference])

These aren't just "usability issues." They are compliance risks that open the door to ADA lawsuits and exclude over 25% of the population.

The fix? It's not about abandoning AI. It's about implementing a "Cyborg" approach:
1. Automate Scans in CI/CD
2. Human-in-the-Loop Audits
3. Build an Evidence Vault

AI is creating a new wave of legal risk for tech companies. But it's also the only scalable way to solve it.

I'm building a playbook for SaaS companies to turn this risk into an advantage. Follow me for more "Cyborg Shield" strategies.

---

## 💬 Engagement Tactics

### First 2 Hours Are Critical
LinkedIn's algorithm prioritizes posts with early engagement.

**Do this immediately after posting:**
1. Reply to every comment (within 15 minutes)
2. Tag 2-3 relevant people who might find it interesting
3. Share in relevant LinkedIn groups
4. Post a comment with additional context
5. Cross-post to Twitter as a thread

### Conversation Starters
Add these to your post or first comment:

- "What AI tools should I audit next? Drop suggestions below 👇"
- "Have you experienced this issue? Share your story."
- "Developers: How would you solve this violation?"
- "What's your biggest accessibility concern with AI?"

### Handle Objections
**"Accessibility is a niche concern"**
→ "25% of the population has disabilities. That's 1 billion people and $13T in spending power."

**"Our users haven't complained"**
→ "70% of accessibility issues are silent failures. Users abandon sites without telling you why."

**"Fixing this is too expensive"**
→ "Domino's Pizza spent $8M on an accessibility lawsuit. Prevention is cheaper than remediation."

**"AI will fix this automatically"**
→ "AI created these problems. AI + human oversight is the solution."

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Claim legal expertise** - "This is illegal" (you're not a lawyer)
2. **Exaggerate severity** - "Everyone will sue them!" (be factual)
3. **Test only once** - Tools update; re-verify before posting
4. **Ignore updates** - If tool fixes the issue, post an update
5. **Bash the company** - Focus on product improvement, not attacks

### ✅ Do This Instead:
1. **Cite WCAG guidelines** - "This violates WCAG 2.1.2"
2. **State facts** - "71% of disabled users abandon sites with chat issues (WebAIM)"
3. **Test thoroughly** - Keyboard, screen reader, visual checks
4. **Give credit** - "Update: [Tool] fixed the keyboard trap issue!"
5. **Offer solutions** - "Here's how to fix this..."

## 💡 Pro Tips

### From Successful Accessibility Advocates:

**Tip 1: Be Solution-Focused**
"Don't just point out problems. Show how to fix them. That's what gets you hired."

**Tip 2: Tag Thoughtfully**
"Tag the AI company in comments, not the post. Gives them a chance to respond without it feeling confrontational."

**Tip 3: Document Everything**
"Keep a spreadsheet of every tool you test. Tool name, date, version, violations found. This becomes your portfolio."

**Tip 4: Engage, Don't Broadcast**
"Reply to every comment. LinkedIn rewards conversations, not monologues."

**Tip 5: Repurpose Content**
"Turn your LinkedIn posts into Twitter threads, blog posts, and newsletter content. One test = 4 pieces of content."

## 📞 Questions?

**Common Questions:**

**Q: What if I'm not an accessibility expert?**
A: You don't need to be. Basic keyboard and screen reader testing is enough to find critical issues. Start simple, learn as you go.

**Q: What if the company responds negatively?**
A: Stay professional. Focus on helping them improve, not shaming. Most companies appreciate constructive feedback.

**Q: How do I handle disagreement about severity?**
A: Cite WCAG guidelines and user research. Stick to facts, not opinions.

**Q: Should I offer paid audits in my posts?**
A: Soft CTA only. "DM for consultation" works. Hard sales pitches hurt engagement.

## 🎬 Example First Post

Here's exactly what to post today:

```
I spent 30 minutes testing ChatGPT for accessibility.

Incredible tool. But I found 3 issues that affect disabled users:

❌ **Regenerate Button Unlabeled:** Screen readers can't identify it. Blind users don't know the option exists. (WCAG 4.1.2)
❌ **Code Blocks Lose Tab Focus:** Keyboard users get stuck in code snippets. (WCAG 2.1.2)
❌ **Contrast Issues in Dark Mode:** Grey text on black fails WCAG 1.4.3 minimum ratio.

These aren't edge cases. They exclude 1 in 4 users.

The fix? OpenAI needs:
1. ARIA labels on all interactive elements
2. Proper focus management in code blocks
3. Contrast audit in dark mode

AI is the future. But only if everyone can use it.

Following along as I audit more AI tools this month.

#Accessibility #AI #WCAG #ChatGPT #Inclusion
```

**Post this, then:**
1. Reply to every comment
2. Track your impressions after 48 hours
3. Analyze what worked
4. Plan your next teardown
